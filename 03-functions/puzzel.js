/**
 * Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, 
 * an infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, 
 * tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number? 
 * 
 * For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice,
 *  whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.
